## Project Overview

**ReShare** is a community-based item sharing web application designed to help local communities reduce waste and save money by encouraging the reuse of unwanted household items. Instead of discarding items, users can give them away to others within their local area for mutual benefit, without any financial exchange.

The platform supports sustainable consumption, promotes environmental responsibility, and strengthens community connections by making sharing simple and accessible.

## Development Methodology

The project follows an **Agile, sprint-based development approach**. Work is divided into iterations (sprints), with tasks tracked using GitHub Projects. Each sprint includes planning, implementation, testing, and review stages.

---

## Sprint 1 Focus

* Project setup and repository configuration
* Express server and PUG templating setup
* MySQL database connection and schema creation
* User authentication (registration and login)
* Docker configuration
* Initial CI/CD pipeline setup

## Team Members & Roles

* **Bhowan Khawas** – Project Management & Testing 
* **Aakriti Gurung** – Frontend Development
* **Abdul Rehman** – DevOps & CI/CD
* **Sameer Shabbir** – Database Design & Integration
* **Ismail Sohail** – Backend Development

*(Roles may overlap to ensure collaborative development.)*

---

## Version Control

Git is used for version control following a feature-branch workflow. All changes are reviewed and merged via pull requests to ensure code quality and collaboration.

---

## Testing Strategy

* Manual testing of core features
* Basic automated tests for critical routes
* Testing integrated into the CI pipeline

---

## Deployment Strategy

The application is containerised using Docker. GitHub Actions automates building, testing, and deployment to ensure consistent and reliable releases.
